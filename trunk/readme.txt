The wpMandrill plugin sends emails that are generated by WordPress through Mandrill, a transactional email service powered by MailChimp.

== Description ==

This plugin uses [Mandrill API](http://mandrillapp.com/api/docs/) to send outgoing emails from your Wordpress installation. It replaces the wp_mail function included with WordPress.

Emails are tracked and automatically tagged for statistics within the Mandrill Dashboard. You can also add general tags to every email sent, as well as particular tags based on selected emails defined by your requirements.

You can send certain types of attachments (image/*, text/* and application/pdf).

You can also use your own templates that have been added to your MailChimp account and shared with your Mandrill account.

There are a few levels of integrations between your WordPress installation and this plugin:

1. The simplest option: Install it, configure it, and wpMandrill will start sending your emails through Mandrill.
1. If you need to fine tune certain emails, you can change any email by creating a filter for the **mandrill_payload** hook.
1. For further customization, we've exposed a function that allows you to send emails from within your plugins, instead of the regular wp_mail function: **wpMandrill::mail**
1. If you need Mandrill Powers, we've included a full-featured class in the file lib/mandrill.class.php, where you'll find every call that can be done through the Mandrill API.

This plugin is currently released as **beta** for early adopter evaluation and finalizing of the initial feature set.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wpMandrill` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the _Plugins_ menu in WordPress
1. Configure plugin in _Settings > Mandrill_
1. Optionally, you can activate and check the **wpMandrill How-Tos** plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I need a Mandrill API key? =

In order to use this plugin, you have to provide one of your Mandrill API keys. That's currently the only way we can get access to your Mandrill account.

= Do I need a MailChimp account? =

Right now, Mandrill is officially in open beta for Mailchimp users. So, yes, you need a MailChimp account in order to create a Mandrill account.

= Is all email routed through Mandrill? =

Yes. We try to send every single email sent through your WordPress installation. We also try to process your headers and attachments.

If the sending fails for any reason, the plugin will try to send it again using the WordPress wp_mail function.
